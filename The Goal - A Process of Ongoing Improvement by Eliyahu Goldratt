Book : THE GOAL A Process of Ongoing Improvement
Author : Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox

Takeaways:
* What's the ultimate goal for any business? - Having a cashflow and improving it.
* What's productivity? - Any means that improves throughout or decreases inventory or operational expense, in a manufacturing industry.
* Money flow: Money In - Throughput ; Money Stuck Inside - Inventory ; Money out - Operational Expense.
* 3 things that measures productivity - Net Income, Return on Investment (RoI), and Cashflow.
* An Investment can be an Inventory - depreciation being operational expense & remaining investment, the inventory.

* Dependent events and Statistical Fluctuations
* Dependent events - actions that are linked to other actions and influence each other.
* Statistical Fluctuations - variations in parameters of actions (such as cycle time, output) that occur over a duration.
* Fluctuations do not average. They accumulate over time.
* Role of plant managers - attempt to achieve a balanced plant - every resource exactly equal in capacity to demand from market.\

* Bottleneck - a resource with capacity =< the demand upon it. otherwise a  non-bottleneck.
* Demand must balance flow, not capacity [Rule 1].
* Flow must be set tiny bit less than demand - else, drop in demand will lose money.

* Total market demand = backlog orders + forecase for new orders (including internal and external sales).
* Higher inventory follows the bottleneck.
* Establish QC prior to bottleneck - allow only parts that fit the QC through it.

* Optimizing Bottlenecks:
  * Make sure bottleneck's time not wasted (idle in lunch break .
  * Not processing already defective parts.
  * Not working on parts not in current demand (spare parts).
* A plant in which every resource is working all time, is inefficient.
* 4-ways a material spends time inside plant
 1. Setup - time spent waiting for a resource (loading into a NC machine).
 2. Process - time spent in modifying the material (machining).
 3. Queue - time spent in waiting for the next resource.
 4. Wait - time spent waiting for another part availability, to be assembled together.

* How to persuade other people?
* How to peel away the layers of common practice?
* How to overcome the resistance to change?

* Inventory as an operational liability - money tied up, takes up space, can get damaged/lost/untraceable over time.
* FIxed overhead variance expense in the Income statement - due to inventory reduction (https://www.perplexity.ai/search/12354d0e-38fd-4ad1-bb46-f794287fcc91#3)

* CC- Capacity Constraint Resources
